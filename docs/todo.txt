- verify/compare theoretical complexity to actual execution times (are plots reasonable?)
- comment on plots
- format and add table of data to appendices for both runs
- finalize source code in appendices
- say that this study could be extended to interpolate exponential/polynomial function to data and
        - approximate constants
        - predict largest inputs that can be processed in 10secs for each algo
- compare performance for small (binary) vs large (alphabetic) alphabets
- distinguish between length computation and LCS reconstruction
- predict largest inputs for 10 secs for each algorithm
