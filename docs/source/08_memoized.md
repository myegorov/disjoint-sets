# Top-Down Memoized Algorithm {#sec:memoized-narrative}

The memoized implementation uses top-down recursion essentially identical
to the naive approach in @sec:naive-listing, except that performed
computations are saved in a table. *TODO*: add pseudo-code.

For the `Python` implementation, see listing in @sec:memoized-listing.
