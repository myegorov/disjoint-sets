# Abstract {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is the abstract -->

Four algorithms that establish the length of a longest common subsequence (LCS)
of two arbitrary strings are implemented and compared side by side. The
preliminary submittal contains the implementations of the naive, memoized and 
bottom-up dynamic algorithms to calculate the length of the LCS, and a sample
run of the main driver program that measures and plots the run time of select
implementations. Not yet implemented are the Hirschberg algorithm, as well as 
the portions of each algorithm (except naive) dealing with LCS reconstruction.
