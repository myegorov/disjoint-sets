# Abstract {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is the abstract -->

I implement and compare side by side four algorithms that compute the
length of and reconstruct a
longest common subsequence (LCS)
of two arbitrary strings.
The asymptotic performance of the algorithms is compared to the actual
execution times.
